## Requirement

(2 persons)  

Person 1:
+ Choose a deterministic game and add exactly one
mechanic that introduces non-determinism.  

Person 2:
+ Playtest the game created by the first person and take
notes.

Present in front of the class the game (person 1) and the
playtesting results (person 2).

## Game

eg: Pool ([example](https://www.miniclip.com/games/8-ball-pool-multiplayer/ro/))

non-determinist / random mechanics:
+ getting different types of effects on the white ball at random, if you manage to hit a ball indirectly (white ball hits ball that hits the target ball, white ball bounces on margin to hit ball ...):
  + splitter ball - ball splits into two, with significantly smaller force
  + anti-magnetic ball - repells all balls around it

The why: has anyone played Breakout more than Super Breakout ?
